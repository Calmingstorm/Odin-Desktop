"""Tests for the evaluative-discipline additions to system + classifier prompts.

Odin's Task 1/2 self-critique identified a gap: completing mechanics
without checking that the delivered artifact actually answered the
request. This test locks the prompt wording that's supposed to
counteract that, so a future edit can't silently remove it.
