"""Local command workspace: the 2026-07-27 wipe mechanism, closed.

The incident: an AE2 jar whose internal layout is ``data/`` was extracted and
then cleaned up with ``rm -rf data``. Local user commands inherited the
service's working directory (the install root), so that relative path resolved
to ``/opt/odin/data`` and deleted Odin's live state.

The isolation proof extracts and reads in a pytest-owned workspace, then
verifies the command's effective cwd without deleting anything. A regression
lands extraction in the fake install and fails the location assertions.
Temporary artifacts are left to pytest's fixture lifecycle, never a recursive
shell deletion. This proves workspace routing, not deletion-command behavior.
