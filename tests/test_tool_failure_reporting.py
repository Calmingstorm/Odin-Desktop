"""Tool failures must be structurally reported as failures.

The executor classifies a bare-string handler return by matching a short list
of prose prefixes ("Error", "Command failed", ...). Any failure phrased
differently was reported as ok=True with no exit code — so the model saw a
success, workflows and schedules continued past the failed step, and the audit
log recorded the action approved with no error.

Found by adversarial review of v3.65.1 and reproduced through the real
executor. These pins drive the PRODUCTION dispatch path, not the handlers
directly, because the classification happens in the executor.
