"""Write-invariant driver for one chat turn.

`TurnDurability` is the seam between the tool loop and the store: the loop
calls the five invariant hooks (Odin's write invariant, round-2) and this
module does the snapshot + fenced persistence. A disabled instance (store
missing/unavailable, admission refused, non-Discord source) no-ops every
hook so the loop keeps ONE code path.

The invariant, mapped to hooks:

1. `on_llm_response`  — the successful LLM response (transcript incl. the
   assistant tool_use message) and ALL proposed tool intents are durable
   BEFORE any execution.
2. `before_tool`      — each intent transitions PREPARED→RUNNING before its
   external effect; a persistence failure here BLOCKS the effect
   (fail-closed).
3. `after_tool`       — each result is persisted immediately after
   completion (APPLIED / DEFINITELY_FAILED / OUTCOME_UNKNOWN for
   timeouts-and-interruptions, which may have applied).
4. `on_batch_settled` — after the parallel batch settles: the tool-result
   continuation message, trajectory/guard/validation/stuck state, and the
   advanced iteration go durable atomically (one fenced checkpoint).
5. `on_guard_injection` — a guard nudge and its consumed one-shot flag are
   durable BEFORE the LLM retry that consumes them.

`on_generation_start` additionally persists the absolute UTC recovery
deadline before each LLM call, so a process restart reconstructs only the
REMAINING budget (never a fresh five minutes).

Failure semantics: hooks raise `TurnStateUnavailableError` / `StaleTurnError`
— the loop halts (fail-closed). Terminal bookkeeping (`settle_terminal`,
`suspend`) is best-effort where no further external effect can follow.
