"""Resolution and validation of the local command workspace.

User-command execution (``run_command``, ``run_script``, ``manage_process``)
used to inherit the service's working directory, which is the install root.
A bare relative path in a command therefore resolved against the live install:
on 2026-07-27 an AE2 jar whose internal layout is ``data/`` was extracted and
then cleaned up with ``rm -rf data``, deleting ``/opt/odin/data``.

This module resolves ONE validated directory that those subprocesses run in
instead. Scope is deliberately narrow:

- It changes where a *bare relative path* lands. Nothing else.
- Explicit ``cd`` still works. Absolute paths still work. ``git -C <path>``
  still works. Deliberately operating inside the install remains possible.
- It does NOT confine the process. ``..``, an absolute path, a symlink placed
  inside the workspace, or archive path traversal can still reach the install.
  Preventing those needs filesystem confinement and would cost capability;
  what this closes is the accidental basename collision that actually bit.

Validation fails CLOSED — callers raise instead of silently falling back to
the inherited cwd, because that fallback is precisely the hazard.

Protected roots are supplied by the caller and canonicalized here, never
assumed (PR #239 review): the install root is ``/app`` under Docker and an
arbitrary path for source checkouts, and packaged ``/opt/odin/data`` is a
SYMLINK to ``/var/lib/odin``, so a naive ``install / "data"`` string check
would happily accept a workspace sitting inside the real live-data directory.
Overlap is rejected in BOTH directions: a workspace that *contains* a
protected root is just as unusable as one nested inside it.
