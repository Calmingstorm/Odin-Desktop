"""Typed tool-call outcomes.

A ``tools/call`` ends in exactly one of three states, and the distinction is
load-bearing for the durability ledger (an uncertain external effect must
never be recorded as success or silently replayed):

- ``ok``        — the server returned a result without ``isError``.
- ``failed``    — definite failure: server ``isError: true``, a JSON-RPC
                  error, a validation failure, an explicit session
                  rejection, or any failure BEFORE the request was written.
- ``uncertain`` — the request was written and the outcome is unknowable
                  (timeout, disconnect, stream loss after send). NEVER
                  automatically replayed.
