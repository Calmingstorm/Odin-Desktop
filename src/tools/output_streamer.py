"""Tool output streaming — ship partial results as tools produce them.

Opt-in per tool via config (``tools.streaming.tools`` list). OFF by default.
Emits ``StreamChunk`` objects to registered async listeners (WebSocket, etc.).
Rate-limited to avoid spamming: at most one chunk per ``chunk_interval``
seconds per active stream. A final chunk (``finished=True``) is attempted on
settlement; a broken listener or cancellation can leave delivery unconfirmed.

Registration happens when the callback is CREATED, so a handler that is
interrupted between setup and completion (tool timeout, cancellation, a
crash inside the handler) has no abandonment path of its own. Three
settlement routes exist, and ordinarily produce the same terminal chunk:

1. ``finish()`` — the handler's own completion path;
2. ``abandon_streams()`` — the executor's ``finally`` for exactly the streams
   the invocation created (tracked in a task-local context variable);
3. ``sweep_stale_streams()`` — the TTL backstop for a stream whose owner
   vanished entirely (process death, cancellation during settlement).
