"""Operator policy for built-in tool visibility (config-gated tools).

One shared policy object answers "is this built-in disabled for this
installation?" for every dispatch surface, reading through a LIVE config
provider — never a captured snapshot, so replacing ``bot.config`` can never
leave dispatch enforcement stale. The catalog filter consumes the same
normalized list at assembly time; this module is the single source of the
name universe (``BUILTIN_TOOL_NAMES``) and of the typed rejection.

Scope includes static and opt-in native built-ins: skills have their own
lifecycle and MCP servers have per-server switches. Disabled built-in
names remain RESERVED — collision checks must use ``BUILTIN_TOOL_NAMES``,
never post-filter visibility, so a skill or MCP tool can never shadow a
disabled built-in.
