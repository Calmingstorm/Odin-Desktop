"""Tool definitions — spawn_agent … wait_for_agents (slice 7/9 of the original TOOLS order).

RFC-004 P1: verbatim positional slice. ORDER IS BEHAVIOR (the tool
catalog feeds prompt assembly) — do not reorder, and do not move
tools between sections; the characterization contract pins the
concatenated order exactly.

The spawn_agent description is composed from a base plus INDEPENDENT per-axis
clauses. The tool catalog re-exposes each axis's field + clause only when the
matching agent config axis is "auto" (see
``src/tools/agent_tool_policy.py``); the static definitions here carry both
(the canonical form). Keep the clauses independent — never combine them into
"model and/or effort" wording, or a single-axis schema would read wrong.
