"""Config-declared paths protected by the local command-workspace fence.

This inventory is shared by the fence and Config Center metadata. A path added
only to one side is dangerous in two different ways: the executor can accept a
workspace that overlaps live state, or the UI can claim a live save while the
running executor still protects its boot-time path.

The boolean records the path's declared shape: ``True`` means a file (protect
its parent directory), while ``False`` means a directory (protect it directly).
