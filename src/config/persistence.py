"""Shared configuration persistence — the one writer every config surface uses.

Three independent writers used to exist: the generic ``PUT /api/config`` path
(plain ``yaml.dump`` of the whole resolved model), the personality endpoints
(same dumper, against a CWD-relative path), and ``llm_admin``'s round-trip
section writer. Only the third was correct. The other two destroyed comments and
key ordering, materialized resolved ``${VAR}`` placeholders into plaintext on
disk, wrote non-atomically, and — because ``bot.config`` was already mutated —
reported success even when the write failed or the file did not exist.

This module generalizes the correct one:

* the target is always the file the live config was LOADED from
  (``active_config_path()``), never a CWD-relative guess;
* the document is edited in place with ruamel round-trip, so comments, ordering,
  quoting, anchors, and untouched ``${VAR}`` placeholders survive; webhook CRUD
  instead splices source spans and validates the result without re-emitting
  unrelated rows or allowing shared anchors;
* only the leaves a caller actually changed are patched — an untouched
  placeholder is never rewritten, because it is never visited;
* the commit is atomic: temp file in the same directory, original mode restored,
  fsync, ``os.replace``, then a best-effort directory fsync;
* failure raises ``ConfigPersistError`` so a mutation endpoint fails loudly
  rather than claiming a phantom save.

``config_transaction()`` serializes every writer. Without one shared lock, a
generic save and an LLM save can interleave between load and write and silently
drop each other's changes.
