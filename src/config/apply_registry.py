"""How every configuration leaf reaches the running bot.

The config page renders apply-mode from THIS module, so the page states what
the code actually does instead of inferring from a value's shape. Every claim
here is a claim about code: if a field is marked live and it is not, the page
becomes a confident liar in the one place built to stop lying.

Resolution order for a path is explicit-leaf, then pattern, then section
default. ``scripts/ci/apply_registry_gate.py`` fails the build when a leaf in a
section known to be non-uniform falls back to that section default, when this
module names a path the schema no longer has, and when a credential-shaped
leaf is classified public. It does NOT catch a new leaf in a section whose
leaves genuinely agree — that one inherits deliberately.

Apply modes
-----------
``live_read``           consumers re-read config; the next read sees it.
``live_apply``          a named apply handler reconfigures the running
                        component. Generic Config saves persist the value but
                        do not dispatch that handler.
``live_for_new_work``   effective for the next spawn/turn; work already running
                        keeps the values it started with, by design.
``restart``             a boot-time snapshot; persisted, effective next start.
``activation_required`` wired, but deliberately gated: saving does not turn it
                        on, so a feature never springs to life on upgrade.
``dormant``             read by nothing at all. Distinct from the above on
                        purpose — telling an operator to "activate" a setting
                        no code consults would send them looking for a switch
                        that does not exist.
``legacy_control``      superseded by an older switch that still governs the
                        behaviour. Reserved for the config page; unused here.

The vocabulary is exactly what the page renders (``APPLY_MODE_LABELS`` in
``ui/js/pages/config.js``). It has to be: the page maps any mode it does not
know onto "Restart required", so an invented mode would tell an operator that
restarting activates something restarting cannot touch.
