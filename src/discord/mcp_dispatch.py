"""The shared MCP dynamic-dispatch seam (MCP campaign P3).

One translation point between the MCP control plane's typed outcomes and
Odin's tool-result world, consumed by all three call paths — the chat tool
loop, the autonomous/agent/scheduled loop path, and background tasks. Call
sites branch on ``manager.has_tool(published_name)`` against the LIVE
publication index (freshness at dispatch); a stale call that loses the race
still fails typed inside ``manager.execute``.

Outcome mapping (the durability contract):

- ``ok``        → ``ToolResult(ok=True)``; dispatch owners retain/cap text
                  and binary attachments, and deliver native image blocks.
- ``failed``    → ``ok=False`` with the failure text (definite — the call did
                  not execute or the server rejected it).
- ``uncertain`` → ``ok=False`` AND ``outcome: "uncertain"`` in
                  ``audit_metadata`` — the request was written and its effect
                  is unknowable; the ledger must record OUTCOME_UNKNOWN and
                  nothing may replay it.

``audit_metadata`` carries bounded enums/identifiers only: server name,
original (pre-namespacing) tool name, config generation, negotiated protocol
version, and the outcome class. Tool ARGUMENTS never enter audit metadata —
MCP argument shapes are arbitrary third-party contracts and may carry
credentials.
