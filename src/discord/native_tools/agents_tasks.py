"""Agents/tasks/loops native tool handlers (RFC-001 P5c, RFC-002 P3).

The fifth handler domain: background-task delegation, autonomous-loop
start/stop, and agent spawn/collect. These
handlers orchestrate the loop pipeline itself, so they take the
ToolLoopRunner directly (constructed before them in
``wiring.build_components``). Narrow-deps since RFC-002 P3: ``get_config``
and ``get_knowledge_store`` are provider callables (config is hot-reload
replaced; the knowledge store is swappable via reload), the LLM surface
is the gateway, and the compression config object is read live through
``get_context_compressor`` (the chat pipeline reads it the same way).
