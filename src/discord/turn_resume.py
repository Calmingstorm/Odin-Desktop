"""Resume machinery for suspended chat turns.

Two entry points (design settled with Odin, 2026-07-30):

- **Explicit resume** — the user replies ``resume``/``continue`` in the
  channel: ``try_explicit_resume`` runs inside the normal intake pipeline
  (channel lock, delivery, session append all inherited), consuming the
  trigger message as a command — it is NEVER injected into the frozen
  transcript. Allowed even after the session has advanced.
- **Auto-resume** — registered at suspension time, in-process only: a
  per-turn waiter polls the model breaker; when capacity returns AND the
  session has not advanced since suspension, the turn resumes and replies
  against the ORIGINAL message. A process restart drops waiters by design —
  after a restart, resume is explicit-only.

Admission (both paths, per the settled design): re-fetch the original
message; require the same author and unchanged content (digest); re-derive
tools from the CURRENT catalog + permission filter — current security
policy always wins over persisted definitions; a deleted or materially
edited request is terminal (``TERMINAL_REJECTED``), never executable
folklore reconstructed from disk.

Replay safety: unmatched ``tool_use`` blocks (crash between intent
recording and batch settle) are repaired from the ledger — APPLIED ops
replay their stored result; anything else becomes an explicit
"outcome unknown / never ran" result block. Matched blocks are guaranteed;
NOTHING is ever re-executed automatically.
