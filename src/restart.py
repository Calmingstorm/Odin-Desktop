"""Process-global in-place restart intent (self-update, setup wizard).

The WebUI self-updater and the first-boot setup wizard both need the
process to come back after they mutate code or config. Historically they
sent SIGTERM to their own pid and trusted the service supervisor to
resurrect the process — which only ``systemd Restart=always`` (or a Docker
restart policy) actually does: a clean exit under ``Restart=on-failure``,
systemd's default ``Restart=no``, or no supervisor at all is a permanent
stop. The endpoints now record restart intent here instead, and ``main()``
re-execs the interpreter in place once the event loop has fully drained —
same PID, so recovery does not depend on any supervisor policy.
