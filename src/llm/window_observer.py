"""Passive context-window observer + downward-only clamps (campaign phase 5).

Odin's normal work is the probe: every emergency rescue already carries the
server's own numbers — the overflow error's rejected input size and the
compressed retry's accepted usage echo (phase 2 stamping). This module turns
those pairs into per-account, per-model evidence and a temporary DOWNWARD
clamp on the budget resolver, so a silent serving-window regression stops
costing repeated overflow round-trips within minutes of first being seen.

Settled semantics (plan of record R2 §11):

- ``data/context_windows.json`` is runtime EVIDENCE, never configuration:
  versioned schema, strict validation, atomic replacement, UTC timestamps,
  opaque account keys only (the phase-2 HMAC identities — no raw account
  material ever lands here).
- One lock guards the complete read–merge–atomic-write transaction; the
  in-memory state is replaced wholesale under that lock and read lock-free
  by the hot path (``active_clamp`` is synchronous and touches no disk).
- A clamp qualifies only when ALL hold: structural overflow, the SAME
  logical request's successful compressed retry, a server-authoritative
  accepted-input echo, canonical model match, and rejection/acceptance on
  the same opaque account. A cross-account retry records both observations
  but derives no clamp for the rejecting account.
- The clamp value IS the successful post-rejection acceptance, exact.
  Clamps are downward-only: fresh evidence at or below a live clamp
  replaces it (value + fresh TTL); higher evidence never raises or clears
  a live clamp early. TTL is 24 hours; expiry is judged lazily at read.
  Manual clearing is account-scoped.
- The active clamp for a model is the minimum non-expired clamp across the
  currently ELIGIBLE pool accounts. Pool knowledge is dependency-inverted:
  the observer consumes opaque-key snapshots and never imports the pool.
- An evidence-write failure logs and forfeits durability — it NEVER turns
  a successful user request into an error. The merged evidence still
  serves this process from memory; the next successful write persists it.
- No probe traffic, no autonomous upward adjustment: growth discovery
  stays a manual procedure.

        Prior belief alone is not enough: belief rests on a density estimate,

        then read its inevitable rejection as capability evidence. That is the
        original defect surviving in a narrower band — and a cold observer is
        the normal state after every restart.

        So the rescue must also survive POST-HOC consistency. When the
        rejection carries its own authoritative input-token echo, that direct
        fact decides whether the rejected payload fit the frozen budget. When
        it does not, the retry that the server accepted supplies a raw density
        sample for this workload; re-run the rejected payload's fit verdict

        is used rather than the smoothed EMA — smoothing is right for future
        admission, wrong for forensics about this specific rescue.

        An unusable accepted sample leaves consistency UNKNOWN, and unknown
        never clamps: clamp evidence must be affirmative, and the absence of
        contradiction is not proof that capacity moved. When a real shrink
        coincides with newly discovered density the clamp is withheld too —
        calibration protects the next request, and a later rejection that is
        still believed within under the corrected density can clamp then. One
