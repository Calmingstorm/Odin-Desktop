"""Model-scoped capacity breakers.

Capacity exhaustion (``server_is_overloaded``) is a property of a MODEL
TIER, not of an account or a client instance: every account sees the same
failure, and rebuilding a client on live reload does not change upstream
capacity. So capacity admission gets its own breaker, keyed by
``provider:effective-model`` and owned by a registry that lives in
``BotServices`` — client rebuilds and live reloads never reset it.

Differences from ``CircuitBreaker`` (which keeps its per-client role for
transport/auth/429 counting):

- **Counted per failed logical generation**, not per HTTP attempt. The
  recovery layer calls :meth:`ModelCapacityBreaker.record_generation_failure`
  exactly once when a whole generation's recovery budget is exhausted.
- **True single-probe half-open.** When the cooldown elapses, exactly one
  caller is admitted as the probe; everyone else keeps waiting until the
  probe resolves. The transport breaker independently reserves its own probe.
- **Adaptive cooldown.** Consecutive opens double the cooldown up to a cap,
  so a long outage probes progressively less often; any success resets it.

Thread-safe; methods are cheap and callable from async code without
awaiting. Waiters poll — the registry deliberately has no cross-event-loop
signalling.
