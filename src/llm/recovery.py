"""Deadline-based recovery for logical LLM generations.

THE shared retry policy across chat, agents, and autonomous loops — one
implementation replacing the three divergent ones (tool_loop's
CircuitOpenError-only sleep-and-retry, the agents' bare-``except`` double
attempt, the loop manager's consecutive-error counter feeding).

Design rules (settled with Odin, 2026-07-30):

- **A monotonic DEADLINE, never an attempt count.** Default five minutes per
  logical generation. Callers resuming a persisted turn pass the remaining
  budget (computed from the checkpoint's UTC deadline) via
  ``deadline_seconds`` — a restart must not grant a fresh five minutes.
  The budget bounds WAITING between attempts, deliberately NOT an in-flight
  attempt: healthy xhigh generations legitimately stream >10 minutes, and
  killing them at a recovery wall is exactly the v3.58.2 disease
  (hardcoded 600s total killing healthy generations). In-flight attempts
  are bounded by the client's own transport limits (request_timeout /
  stream_stall_timeout) and are cancellable via ``cancel_event`` at any
  moment (/stop interrupts the await itself, not just the sleeps).
- **Retryable**: ``LLMCapacityError``, ``LLMTransportError``, and
  ``CircuitOpenError`` (the client breaker — recovery waits THROUGH it
  rather than treating it as terminal). Full-jitter backoff capped at
  ``backoff_cap``; a server-suggested ``retry_after`` is honoured as a floor
  (clamped to ``retry_after_cap``), and every wait is bounded by the
  remaining budget.
- **Fast-fail**: ``LLMAuthError``, ``LLMRequestError``, and
  ``LLMRateLimitError`` — rate-limit is deliberate: by the time the client
  raises it, internal account rotation is already exhausted, and cycling
  limited accounts for five minutes would change quota semantics.
- **No bare ``except``**: an unclassified exception is a programming defect
  and escapes immediately (retrying defects was the agents-path bug — fixed
  here, not spread).
- **Model-breaker discipline**: one admission per attempt via the
  token-resolution protocol; exactly ONE ``record_generation_failure`` when
  the whole generation exhausts on capacity. Non-capacity outcomes abandon
  the probe without escalating.
- **Cancellable**: waits race the caller's cancel event; cancellation
  propagates as ``asyncio.CancelledError`` and always releases a held probe.
