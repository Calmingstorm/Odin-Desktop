"""Per-model context-budget resolution (pure functions; campaign phase 1).

The single derivation authority from capability (budget floors and operator
overrides), evidence (observed clamps), and policy (utilization, explicit
character ceiling) down to the character targets compaction consumes:

    base_budget        = override[model] ?? floor[model] ?? 272_000
    effective_budget   = min(base_budget, observed_clamp)      # when present
    working_budget     = effective_budget × utilization%
    compactable_tokens = max(0, working_budget − 42_000)       # total: never negative
    derived_chars      = compactable_tokens × density           # density = chars/token
    primary_chars      = min(derived_chars, explicit ceiling)  # when non-null
    rung_1             = primary_chars × 0.7
    rung_2             = min(rung_1, 400_000)
    ladder             = positive rungs only, deduplicated, non-increasing

All arithmetic is exact integer math (density as ×milli//1000, percentages and
the 0.7 ratio as integer products before floor division) — identical to the
settled floor()-form for non-negative operands, with no float drift. At the
default density (2500 milli) ``× 2500 // 1000`` is bit-identical to the
historical ``× 5 // 2`` for every non-negative operand.

Semantics settled with Odin (plan of record R2, 2026-08-17):

- Budgets are known-safe usable INPUT floors, already below the server's
  output reservation — nothing here subtracts an output reserve.
- The 42K envelope reserve covers the fixed request material that rides
  outside compactable history (system prompt, tool schemas).
- Observed clamps are runtime evidence and deliberately bypass the operator
  override bounds; the resolver is TOTAL under any clamp value — when no
  positive rescue rung exists, recovery must fail honestly rather than
  fabricate a target.
- The 272K legacy floor means utilization never reduces a budget at or below
  272K: small models keep their full derived targets; the policy knob only
  bites above ~453K budgets.
- 400_000 chars is the rescue ceiling for models with a ≥272K usable budget
  (it survives every historically served ≥272K window class); the ``min``
  keeps smaller models and low overrides/clamps on their own smaller rung —
  recovery never enlarges context.
- Resolution is snapshotted per logical generation: the model and its budget
  travel together through retries and rescue rungs; live configuration
  changes reach the NEXT generation only.
- Density is WORKLOAD evidence supplied by the caller (the window observer),
  never read here: this module stays pure and observer-independent, exactly
  like ``observed_clamp``.
- Utilization is QUALITY POLICY; overflow is PHYSICS. ``working_budget`` is
  the policy target that ordinary soft compaction serves. Predictive
  admission decisions and clamp qualification consult ``effective_budget``
  (believed physical capacity) instead — turning a policy preference into a
  hard admission wall would both distort behavior and make an aggressive
  policy setting indistinguishable from a genuine window shrink.
