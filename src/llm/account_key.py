"""Opaque, installation-local account keys for provider evidence.

The context-window observer correlates a rejection with its rescue
acceptance only when both landed on the SAME account — but raw account
identifiers must never be exposed or persisted in evidence, exceptions, or
logs. This module derives a deterministic, non-reversible, installation-
local key: HMAC-SHA256 of the stable non-secret account identifier (the
ChatGPT account id — an identity label, never token material), keyed by a
random per-installation secret established on first use.

Contract (plan of record R2 §10/§11, hardened in PR #272 review round 1):

- Same account + same installation ⇒ same key across restarts AND across
  concurrent processes: first use runs an exclusive-winner protocol
  (temp-file write + fsync, then an atomic hard-link publication that fails
  if a winner already exists; losers read and use the winner's material, so
  every process converges on the one durable secret).
- Persisted material is accepted only on the exact generated shape: a
  regular file (final-component symlinks refused), owned by this process's
  uid, mode 0600, exactly 32 bytes. Anything else fails CLOSED — a warning,
  ``None``, and the questionable material left untouched (replacing it
  would silently decorrelate every previously recorded observation).
- No stable account identity — including an identifier that cannot be
  UTF-8 encoded, e.g. an unpaired surrogate smuggled through credentials
  JSON — ⇒ ``None``, and the attempt is disqualified from account-scoped
  evidence. Key trouble degrades evidence, never requests: the public
  function is total and non-raising by construction.
- The key file lives under the runtime ``data`` directory; it never leaves
  the installation, so keys from different installs never correlate.
