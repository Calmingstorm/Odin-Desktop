"""Typed LLM provider errors.

Classified from structured provider signals (SSE error events, HTTP status
exhaustion) instead of leaving every failure a bare ``RuntimeError`` string.
The recovery layer keys its retry/fast-fail decision on these types; the
subsystem guard and circuit breakers key their counting on them.

Compatibility constraints (both load-bearing):

- Every class subclasses ``RuntimeError``: legacy consumers catching
  ``RuntimeError``/``Exception`` keep working, and message text keeps the
  provider's bounded shape.
- ``retry_after`` is a plain attribute (``float | None``) because two
  consumers discover it by duck typing (``hasattr(err, "retry_after")``):
  ``src/agents/manager.py`` and ``src/tools/autonomous_loop.py``.

Only whitelisted, safe fields ride on the exception: ``provider``,
``model``, ``retry_after``, ``code`` (the provider's structured error code,
e.g. ``context_length_exceeded`` — consumers key recovery decisions on it
instead of substring-matching message text). Raise sites never embed raw
response bytes in the message: HTTP-status branches embed a bounded,
structure-aware descriptor (status + token-validated MIME + byte count
for edge-shaped bodies; sanitized known JSON error fields for structured
ones — see ``openai_codex._describe_error_body``), and SSE terminal
events get the same known-field treatment (``CodexStreamError``), so no
LLMError message ever carries an HTML fragment. User-facing presentation
still goes through ``format_user_facing_error`` at the boundary —
defense in depth, never single-layer.
