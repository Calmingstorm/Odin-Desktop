"""Every config leaf must declare how it reaches the running bot.

The config page renders apply-mode from ``src/config/apply_registry.py``. A leaf
the registry cannot classify would be rendered by guessing, and a guess in the
page built to stop guessing is worse than saying nothing.

Walks the Pydantic models rather than a dumped instance, so nested and optional
sub-models (``openai_codex.retry.max_retries``, ``email.smtp.password``) are
checked too — a dump hides every branch that happens to be ``None`` today.

Fails when:
  * a schema section has no registry entry;
  * a leaf inside a section declared non-uniform (``MIXED_SECTIONS``) has no
    explicit classification, and would silently inherit an unchecked claim;
  * the registry names a section or leaf the schema no longer has;
  * a credential-shaped leaf is explicitly declassified to ``public``.
