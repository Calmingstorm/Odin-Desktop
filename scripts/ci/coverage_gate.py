"""Coverage gate: fail when any gated file's MISSED-line count grows (RFC-006 P0).

Total coverage percent is trash as a gate — it is trivially gamed by adding
well-tested code elsewhere. The ratchet here (RFC-006 R1, Odin's shape):

- PRIMARY: per-file missed-line-count CEILING — for every gated file in the
  committed baseline, ``missing <= baseline_missing`` (epsilon 0). Punishes
  adding untested code; never punishes deleting dead uncovered code; cannot
  be masked by newly covered lines elsewhere in the same file.
- SECONDARY: per-file percent non-regression, ``percent >= baseline - 0.25``
  (noise epsilon only).
- New gated files must meet their bucket threshold (security 90 / core 85).
- Baseline entries with no matching current file are SURFACED and fail the
  gate until the baseline is deliberately updated — renames and deletions
  are reviewed, never silently passed.
- The baseline changes only via ``--update-baseline``, which prints a
  before/after table (improved / unchanged / DECREASED) for the PR review.
- Total percent is reported, never gated.

Usage:
    python scripts/ci/coverage_gate.py                  # gate against baseline
    python scripts/ci/coverage_gate.py --update-baseline  # regenerate + table
    python scripts/ci/coverage_gate.py --coverage-json F  # reuse an existing report

Exit codes: 0 = pass, 1 = gate findings (printed), 2 = setup/tooling failure
(missing report, failed suite, unparseable baseline — the gate fails CLOSED).
